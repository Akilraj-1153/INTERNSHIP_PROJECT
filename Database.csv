48,CIVIL ,Autodesk Certified Professional: AutoCAD for Design and Drafting Exam Prep,udemy,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,UNPAID ,-,4,I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.
49,CIVIL ,Renewable Energy and Green Building Entrepreneurship,udemy,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,PAID ,1000,5,This course doesn't contain any new information. It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.

70,MATHS ,Single Variable Calculus,udacity,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,PAID ,1000,4,"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice."

The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...Â£40..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Coursera already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only Â£32 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price.

186,CSE/IT/AI,Machine Learning,simplilearn,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,PAID ,1000,4,"Excellent course, first 3 weeks were very technical but highly informative. Quite a bit of accounting knowledge is required to understand the work. Last week of lessons were more simple and intuitive to understand, but overall, a very insightful module"
187,CSE/IT/AI,"Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines",udacity,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,UNPAID ,-,5,"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations. Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here. ""I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to"" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're ""stocked"" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that ""we're going to run some narly regressions"", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants. These segments add absolutely zero value. They lengthen the time of the course. To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together."

The material is presented in an interesting manner with extensive use of Excel spreadsheets to demonstrate the calculation and application of common performance metrics and ratios. The test are challenging and interesting. I retook test I had passed because the information cover was interesting and the test provided an excellent learning opportunity. The fourth week deals with liking non-financial measures to financial performance. Within a typical organization, these parameters are often the ones employees most affect and are often measured against. The concepts and methods of evaluating presented with examples to demonstrate some of the problems with linking non-financial measures to financial performance.I will be able to use what I have learned from both of these classes in my current job. I evaluate current business strategies of my company against competitive business strategies. Since the competitive business strategies must be deduced from a combination of published information and reported financial performance, the first three weeks will be of greatest benefit in this aspect of my job. The last week will be of more benefit as I help business organization within my company develop their business strategies."

321,AUTO/MECH,Metrology and inspection,udemy,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,PAID ,1000,4,"It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs. I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all. There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace. It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly. The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers. It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost. It was pretty good, though. I liked how it contained specific examples and charts."

Honestly, you have to try!!"
329,AUTO/MECH,Mechanical Drives and It's types,simplilearn,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,UNPAID ,-,5,"A little tough sometimes, but very instructive"
330,AUTO/MECH,Basics of Mechanical Engineering,udacity,ONLINE,CERTIFIED ,UNPAID ,-,5,"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the â€œtell me what I just told you typeâ€ but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students â€œplayâ€ with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or twoâ€¦ â€œchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?â€ I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going â€œyeahâ€¦ that makes sense. I understandâ€¦â€ I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they donâ€™t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require â€œparrotingâ€ something said in the video.Iâ€™m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholderâ€™s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a â€œthink about what this meansâ€ type question that is not necessarily â€œmarkedâ€ but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they â€œgo look at the spreadsheetâ€. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more â€œhand holdingâ€ and â€œdirectionâ€ in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little â€œscaryâ€ for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.Iâ€™m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes â€“ this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 â€“ Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 â€“ talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an â€œincrease means slower future recognitionâ€. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 â€“ no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benfordâ€™s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures â€“ some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students â€“ particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students â€“ perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They donâ€™t need to be long or complicated â€“ just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to â€œplayâ€ with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of â€œmessingâ€ it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a â€œplaygroundâ€ sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another â€“ so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios â€“ one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I donâ€™t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live."
